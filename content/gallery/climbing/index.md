summary: "Why make fulfillment from climbing a mountain different from solving a difficult problem in the company you work for?"

Last month, I and my fellows colleagues were in a trekking tour 2 days 1 night to the top of [Tanang Phan Dung](https://vietnamtourism.gov.vn/post/32062). Enjoying the rare time with no internet and emails. We went through a journey of 35km under rain forest, through multiples hills, mountains and streams. It was a difficult but fun and memorable trip for all of us. 

After the trip few days, we gathered around and there was one question about: "What makes you remember the most in the trekking journey?", the collected answers unveiled a remarkable discovery for life.

Surprisingly, none of the responses mentioned the easy part of the journey, but all of them related to the most difficult and challenging situations, like going on a vertical cliff, or falling in a slippery road, or enduring knee pains, and so on. 

It turns out the challenges embed deeper into people's mind than the easy thing does. And simply going through such difficulties could make people feel rewarding and fulfilling, even without anyone to recognize the effort but themselves. 

In our life, especially in our career, it's equivalent experience of such up and down journey, and we tend to remember the most difficult period of our life, than the easy one. However, when talking about fulfilment, there is a significant difference in term of perception. 

With mountain climbing, we don't demand anything in return to have fulfilment, but our own experience through the journey. 
With career advancement, we demand reward for any challenge we overcome.

And if we don't receive any, we are far from fulfilment, but disappointment and lost. 

If you recognize this, you might have a question from within: "Why we let our own fulfillment depend on someone else's recognition?". That's a good question that indeed we should have asked earlier, and more frequently. 

But now we might find something better by asking: "What should I do to achieve true fulfillment in life?" - simply by just climbing a mountain that you like. Do the thing that you are interested in, overcome the challenge along the way, and you'll be fulfilled with your own satisfaction. 

That's the true fulfillment.
