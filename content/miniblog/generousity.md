Generousity is not limited to praising, or giving away more than one's deserved. 

It's a way to live a fulfilment life. 

A father doesn't hold any anger with his child for long, he can forgive easily. 
A leader doesn't wait for the followers come and bless him in a special event, if they don't, simply he just doest it for them.

Some might ask: what is the source of generousity?

Conventional way of thinking, it could be because the beholders having too much of what they can give away. This can be found in different charitable projects. Transactional wise, it reflects the appreciation of one's contribution, that exceeds some kind of expectation. 
But those couldn't clarify the cause of earlier examples of generousity.

A hypothesis of true generousity is generated by the empathy of shortage, shortage of basic needs, shortage of understanding, shortage of love, shortage of appreciation, and shortage of belief. 

Conventional generousity is an inevitable force to the balance point of the universe.
True generousity is the genuine truth of no self, but interbe. 

And getting to the truth is being in the path of happiness.
